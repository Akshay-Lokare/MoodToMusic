📅 Suggested Build Order
- Day 1–2 → Mood Log screen + storage
- Day 3 → Playlist suggestions (static links)
- Day 4 → History screen + chart
- Day 5 → Notifications + settings
- Day 6 → Polish UI + optional Spotify API integration
- Day 7 → Testing, bug fixes, demo prep

👉 This way, you’ll have a working MVP by midweek and can spend the last few days polishing or adding stretch features.
Do you want me to draft the mood → playlist mapping table (e.g., Happy → “Happy Hits”, Sad → “Lo-Fi Chill”) so you can plug it in right away without worrying about API integration first?
